# @recubed/tasks

Curated (arbitrary) set of **functional async primitives**, including lightweigt native wrappers (`Task`), alternatives (`Parallel` -> `Promise.allSettled`) and utilities for non-(yet)-existent features (`Sequence`). Mostly there to support my incoming `Redux` REST client but could be of use independently;

Heavily influenced by ideas borrowed from functional languages (i.e. purity, function composition, variants, f-algebras, catamorphisms) and other JavaScript libraries (e.g. `fp-ts`).
